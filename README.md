# principles-of-data-science-python
This is a folder to allow me to work on my JupyterLab from 2 computers (desktop and laptop). This will hold notebooks and files related to running the code examples in Principles of Data Science. This is for myself to get a refresher on python while also learning Data Science.

I am learning Data Science so that I can become a Microsoft Certified Azure Data Science trainer. I need to learn enough python to pass their certification exam for DP-100. My spare time (primarily when I'm on my laptop, but I wanted to ensure my PC could do the work if needed too) is to be used reading Principles of Data Science and executing the Python code. The first 10 chapters are things I know about from when I was a student, and its pretty heavy in math in parts (which I know) so I'm expeccting a lot of boredom if I just read through. However one really cool feature is that they are learning these math concepts using python, so though I am tempted to skip, I think there's value in going through to round out concepts I don't completely know and I can keep myself entertained by doing the python exercises in JupyterLab/Python - which is used by Azure ML. Further, this could make me a better math educator (likely just keep current - since over time more people will know basic coding). Lastly, I'm currently learning GitHub, so really, I'm killing THREE birds with one stone!
